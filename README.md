## Main Frontend for Manu Project

This is the main frontend made using React, TailwindCSS, Prism, and Material UI Components.

This is still a very early WIP, with most features not working.

The project is open source under the GNU General Public License.


## The Manu Project

Manu, being latin for 'By the hand' is mean to be a platform for learning coding in a hands-on manner.

The general idea is that one can follow a course, which is comprised of lessons which are to be read, and then completeing the challenge at the end of each lesson.

The project is a heavy WIP, and development is slow because I am unable to dedicate much time to coding due to school and studying.
